# Branch manipulation

## Move work from one branch to another 
[as explained in SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/556923/how-to-merge-my-local-uncommitted-changes-into-another-git-branch)

```git
git stash
git checkout branch2
git stash pop
```

can let you work on another branch first. 

No need to wait for your boss to check and merge your PR now! 

# [Untrack config files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9794931/keep-file-in-a-git-repo-but-dont-track-changes)

In my coulasis repo, 
I have a config file storing the username and password for the kyoto University student system,
but I don't want it to sync with my remote repo on Github.

The reason is that I need to write in my own account information if I want to use the code locally,
but I certainly don't want my account to be public,
neither do I want to gitignore the file,
for other people who clone my code would need the template config file.

I solved it by 

`git update-index --assume-unchanged login.txt`

it result in no changes of the `login.txt` in the remote repo,
but I can edit my local config file freely now.
