I am considering adding two new features to my blog, "tweet" and "diary".

This blog will record what I found necessary or interesting when learning to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

# Why new features?

## Tweet

Sometimes I come across a good idea and would like to write a blog about it, [like an obscure mistake in programming]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-01-Counterexample-of-Abusing-Simultaneous-Assignments-in-Python %}).

Other time I would start a great project (might not finish ever) and record how I solve some the problems (or what I cannot solve) along the way.

However, more often, I only have a fraction of idea, but I want to record it to somewhere. 
For some I would preferably write to a public area (why? I don't know), but certainly not twitter.

So probably I should tweet on my website.

## Diary

I would also like to keep a diary that has nothing to do with studying.
But there is a limitation for static website: uploading photos is inconvenient, and probably I would not like to write everything into a public area.

Well, I may as well choose a social media(instagram?) to achieve this in the end.
