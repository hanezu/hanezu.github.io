In [Angular guide for unit-testing](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing), Karma is a JavaScript command line tool that can be used to spawn a web server which loads your application's source code and executes your tests. And Jasmine is a behavior driven development framework for JavaScript that has become the most popular choice for testing AngularJS applications. Here is [Introduction for Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html)

The describe function is for grouping related specs. Specs are defined by calling the global Jasmine function it, which, like describe takes a string and a function. Suites and specs can be disabled with the xdescribe and xit functions, respectively. 

To log into console when using Jasmine, [use console.log directly.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35711329/how-to-log-values-in-jasmine)
