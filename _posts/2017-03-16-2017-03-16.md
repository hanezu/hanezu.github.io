## new and initialize

Very basic points but I made mistake here.

In [this blog](http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/03/15/ruby-contructors/), read the

## Debug with rescue

I was trying to render a response of status 400 if JSON parse fails.

```ruby

	begin
      pref = JSON.parse(connection.pref_json)
    rescue ParserError
      render json: {error: "unable to parse #{connection.pref_json} to JSON"}, status: 400
      return
    end

```

But it does not work.

With the help of rails debugger (Thanks god it is so handy in RubyMine), I found out that I did not catch the Error at all, so the status response was 500 instead of 400.

In fact, the error that I should catch is `JSON::ParserError`. It is really a nightmare for Javaer using `import` to switch to Ruby. But anyway, module is a clever idea and I should get to be familiar with it.

## The class for `user.windows`

[ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/CollectionProxy.html)

Useful method such as #find, #size, can be used in rspec.

## Reload in Association

There is a User who owns some windows, and the association has inverss. when I add a window by 

```ruby

        window.user = user
        window.save!

```

It turns out that

```
0> window.user
=> #<User id: 1, email: "bertrand@doyle.info", created_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:04", updated_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:04", access_key: nil, nickname: "Andy Beahan", stripe_customer_id: nil, payment_method: 0>

0> user1.windows
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy []>

```

It seems that the association fails. But when I do

```

0> window.user.windows
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [#<Window id: 1, user_id: 1, device_serial: "AW101-0000000000", model: "AW101", name: nil, created_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:05", updated_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:05">]>

```

The association actually does the job! So I run

```

0> user1.reload
=> #<User id: 1, email: "bertrand@doyle.info", created_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:04", updated_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:04", access_key: nil, nickname: "Andy Beahan", stripe_customer_id: nil, payment_method: 0>

0> user1.windows
=> #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [#<Window id: 1, user_id: 1, device_serial: "AW101-0000000000", model: "AW101", name: nil, created_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:05", updated_at: "2017-03-16 02:26:05">]>

```

and it's set.

## return render ?

I encountered this code snippet.

```ruby
return render json: ErrorCode::U09.to\_hash, status: 400
```

and what is it different from

```ruby 
render json: ErrorCode::U09.to_hash, status: 400
return 
```

The answer [by SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37810599/return-render-vs-render-and-return-in-rails) is that we should avoid return render, because

> I don't believe anything is actually listening for the return value of the controller actions.


## irb Class

The book [Programming Ruby - The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/index.html) is fantastic. I'm reading the paperback at home, but it actually come with a free e-book.

And in its chapter [Interactive Ruby Shell](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/irb.html), it recommend a nice way of playing with your codes: by sneaking into your class/object using irb subsession.

Basically, I can do

```irb

load 'error_code.rb'
 => true

2.3.1 :003 > irb ErrorCode
2.3.1 :001 > jobs
 => #0->irb on main (#<Thread:0x007fea4c0673e8>: stop)
#1->irb#1 on ErrorCode (#<Thread:0x007fea4b832c40>: running) 
```

Then I am on the way to go and playing my ErrorCode's constants.

## Model A has\_one Model B: create together

I have two model that are one-on-one and onto with each other, say, a Window and a WindowConnection.

It is possible that I put 

```ruby

 after_create :create_window_connection

```

to Window, so that I can use `c = window.connection` without initialization.
