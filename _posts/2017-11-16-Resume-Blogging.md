The reason I resume my blog after several months is LeNPaul's new update that integrates features such as comment and Google analytics to this theme. This is just what I want (after comparing with other CMS such as HubPress or PageKit). 

To be specific, my ideal blogging experience would be:  

- create my post locally in WebStorm and Vim extension
- able to format paragraphs in markdown and equations in LaTeX
- write some scripts (in Ruby, which I unfortunately no longer familiar with) for fancy extensions that boost blogging experience
- commit and push it to GitHub Pages without managing a web server
- interactive (at least reader can comment)
- aware of the statistics of the website

And they are all possible thanks to [LeNPaul](https://github.com/LeNPaul) who created and continue to maintain this cool Jekyll theme.

And it seems that so much has changed since my first download that I need to adapt to hereafter.

In addition, I started to use [Weava](https://www.weavatools.com/), a chrome extension that enable website highlighting. With this great tool I no longer need to record any tips for programming or environment setup. So all of these kinds of posts are archived [here](https://hanezu.github.io/menu/archive.html). 

Indeed, I recently came to realize the benefit of conveying some ideas to some listeners, whether they are students, professors or laymen. It is the moment we let someone know an idea when we master that idea. So I decide to change my blogging style and instead sharing my insights of recent works of mine or others, in a way that is informative for you, the visitors of my blog, regardless of technical knowledge.

Well, wish me a merry blogging :)
