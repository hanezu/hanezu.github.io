# Staging?

Under Wiki's [Deployment environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment), 
:	Staging (STAGE) is a pre-production environment, for final testing immediately prior to deploying to production.

Another definition
:	ステージングとは、システムを公開する手前の段階で、実際にサービスを提供する環境（本番環境）とほぼ同じ環境にシステムを反映させ、動作や表示などの最終確認を行う段階、もしくは環境のことである。

It seems that understanding **Deployment Environment** is essential to understanding staging.
:	In software deployment, an environment or tier is a computer system in which a computer program or software component is deployed and executed.

To understand it, think of *Deployment Environment* as Earth's crust. *Tiers* exist, from *Local* (unpushed commits), *Development* (server), *Testing* (before merging to master), *Stage* (master branch), to *Production* (release-1.2.3).
