I was looking for a way to [edit the code in my laptop 
and do the training/execution/deployment in a cloud service.](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-train-a-neural-network-in-the-cloud-using-Tensorflow)
I decided to use Google Cloud 
(although AWS may also be a good choice)
to work out my way to train CNNs.
(Hopefully I won't spend a lot on it.
Google promise that it is the cheapest, 
but obviously owning your own GPU is more economic)
