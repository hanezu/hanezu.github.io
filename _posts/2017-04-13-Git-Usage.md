# Branch manipulation

## Move work from one branch to another 
[as explained in SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/556923/how-to-merge-my-local-uncommitted-changes-into-another-git-branch)

```git
git stash
git checkout branch2
git stash pop
```

can let you work on another branch first. 

No need to wait for your boss to check and merge your PR now! 

# [Untrack files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9794931/keep-file-in-a-git-repo-but-dont-track-changes)

## leave template in the remote repository, and configure it locally 

In my coulasis repo, 
I have a config file storing the username and password for the kyoto University student system,
but I don't want it to sync with my remote repo on GitHub.

The reason is that I need to write in my own account information if I want to use the code locally,
but I certainly don't want my account to be public,
neither do I want to gitignore the file,
for other people who clone my code would need the template config file.

I solved it by 

`git update-index --assume-unchanged login.txt`

it result in no changes of the `login.txt` in the remote repo,
but I can edit my local config file freely now.

## delete remote file without removing local files

I have once accidentally added `.idea` to the remote. 
In this case,
[removing it only remotely](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143796/remove-a-file-from-a-git-repository-without-deleting-it-from-the-local-filesyste)
best solve the problem.
