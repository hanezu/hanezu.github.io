# Hello world!

I have decided to write posts one month ago, but did not configure the github page correctly.

But in the end nothing can stop me from writing posts!

Thanks to my intern at a startup company Atmoph last month, I am getting comfortable with website. I get to know how website works, which help me configure the blog write.

# What I would like to write

I start this blog mainly to write how I face and solve problems and my inspiration in work and study. I write posts so that others can benefit from it, and it would also act as a reminder for my thought process.

I would also share my reading and browsing on Machine Learning, Math, Programming, and anything else I am interested in.

I do not plan to post article about my life here. It should be a place for conversation on learning. Although I may write posts that have no connection with my study, which I probably would put under _random_ tag.

I choose English as the formal language, but Chinese or Japanese may pop up here and there. If you are not confortable with them, just skip them. I would not write Chinese or Japanese for important topic without translation.

# To readers

If you like my article, please tell me via Facebook or Twitter, Although I am still not confortable with them and may miss your message. You may also repost my article if you would tell me in advance.
