If you are kind enough to check my code for hosting this blog, you can see that I am using some Ruby scripts to create post templates, or rename post.

But as I get more engaged in writing posts and needs more functions, `ruby ***.rb` is getting clumsy.

So I decides to build a CLI for this blog in Ruby.
