title: About

I would like to share anything on Machine Learning, Math, Programming, and whatever I am interested in.

I would also like to share how I configure my computer to make life easier (I hope) since configuring environment is a huge headache for every programmer.

I initially wrote blog in time order. But this turn out to be in fact disordered, so I switched to topic order.

I choose English as the main language, but Chinese or Japanese may pop up here and there. I would not write Chinese or Japanese for an important topic without translation.
