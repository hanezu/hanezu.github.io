## What I would like to write

I start this blog mainly to write about how I face and solve problems and my inspiration in working and studying. I write posts so that others can benefit from it, and it would also act as a reminder for my thought process.

I would also share my reading and browsing on Machine Learning, Math, Programming, and anything else I am interested in.

I do not plan to post articles about my life here. It should be a place for conversation on learning. Although I may write posts that have no connection with my study, which I probably would put under the _random_ tag.

I choose English as the formal language, but Chinese or Japanese may pop up here and there. If you are not comfortable with them, just skip them. I would not write Chinese or Japanese for an important topic without translation.
