# Branch manipulation

## Move work from one branch to another 
[as explained in SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/556923/how-to-merge-my-local-uncommitted-changes-into-another-git-branch)

```git
git stash
git checkout branch2
git stash pop
```

can let you work on another branch first. 

No need to wait for your boss to check and merge your PR now! 

# [Untrack files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9794931/keep-file-in-a-git-repo-but-dont-track-changes)

## leave template in the remote repository, and configure it locally 

In my coulasis repo, 
I have a config file storing the username and password for the kyoto University student system,
but I don't want it to sync with my remote repo on GitHub.

The reason is that I need to write in my own account information if I want to use the code locally,
but I certainly don't want my account to be public,
neither do I want to gitignore the file,
for other people who clone my code would need the template config file.

I solved it by 

`git update-index --assume-unchanged login.txt`

it result in no changes of the `login.txt` in the remote repo,
but I can edit my local config file freely now.

## delete remote file without removing local files

I have once accidentally added `.idea` to the remote. 
In this case,
[removing it only remotely](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143796/remove-a-file-from-a-git-repository-without-deleting-it-from-the-local-filesyste)
best solve the problem.

# Sync with upstream remote

Suppose I want to renew the framework of my blog, [Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange)  my first thought is to download the package from his GitHub and move my posts back to the new package.

Actually, all I need to do is to [set his repo as my upstream](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/), and [syncing from it](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

This is a cool feature that keep forks updated.

By the way, the reason I resume my blog after several months is LeNPaul's new update that integrates features such as comment and Google analytics to this theme. This is just what I want (after comparing with other CMS such as HubPress or PageKit). 
To be specific, my ideal blogging experience would be  

- interactive (at least reader can comment)
- able to know how many people have read my post
- create my post locally in WebStorm
- able to format paragraphs in markdown and equations in LaTeX
- write some Ruby scripts (which I unfortunately almost forget) for fancy blogging extensions
- commit and push it to GitHub Pages without managing a web server

and they are all possible thanks to [LeNPaul](https://github.com/LeNPaul) who created and continue to maintain this cool Jekyll theme.
