## to get access to a ruby file in irb

[There are two ways:](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13112245/ruby-how-to-load-a-file-into-interactive-ruby-console-irb/27509036#27509036)

> to load source without running the program -- this gives access to all variables and functions:
source("filename.rb")

> to run program and then drop into interactive mode -- this only gives access to functions, not variables:
require("filename.rb")

It is really convenient using `source 'file.rb'` to load session to your current irb and try anything you want on the initialized variables.


## irb into a Class

The book [Programming Ruby - The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/index.html) is fantastic. I'm reading the paperback at home, but it actually come with a free e-book.

And in its chapter [Interactive Ruby Shell](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/irb.html), it recommend a nice way of playing with your codes: by sneaking into your class/object using irb subsession.

Basically, I can do

```irb

load 'error_code.rb'
 => true

2.3.1 :003 > irb ErrorCode
2.3.1 :001 > jobs
 => #0->irb on main (#<Thread:0x007fea4c0673e8>: stop)
#1->irb#1 on ErrorCode (#<Thread:0x007fea4b832c40>: running) 
```

Then I am on the way to go and playing my ErrorCode's constants.
